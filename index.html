                <h1>Rewat Singh</h1>
                <p>I’m the architect of invisible bridges — weaving together networks, automation, and security into seamless digital experiences that not only work, but inspire trust. Each line of code, each configuration, is a hidden beam in an architecture where performance meets resilience, and security is stitched into the very fabric. What I build is quiet in its elegance, yet powerful enough to stand unwavering in a world of constant change.</p>

    <!-- About Section -->
    <section id="about">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a DevOps Engineer with 5 years of IT experience, including over 3 years dedicated to cloud-native infrastructure, CI/CD automation, and delivering secure, scalable, and observable systems. My strong foundation in networking and system administration gives me the versatility to work across the full spectrum of modern infrastructure — from bare-metal troubleshooting to multi-cloud deployments. I actively share my hands-on work through real-world projects on GitHub, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and practical application.</p>

            <p>My journey began right after earning my B.Tech degree, driven by a deep passion for cybersecurity. I immersed myself in Linux systems, networking fundamentals, scripting, and problem-solving through capture-the-flag competitions. Understanding how networks function—from the first packet transmitted to the architecture that supports system uptime—became my foundation. Cybersecurity shaped my mindset early on. I explored firewalls, intrusion detection, vulnerability assessments, and learned to think like both attacker and defender. This experience instilled the discipline, curiosity, and precision required to work at the core of modern technology. Curiosity pushed me further into the realms of machine learning and data science, where I experimented with models, algorithms, and real-world datasets. This exploration helped me appreciate how data transforms into insights, and how automation and intelligence can enhance technology solutions.</p>

            <p>Professionally, I started as a Network Engineer — ensuring uptime, optimizing performance, and designing networks that could not fail. Even when a career break came, I never truly stepped away. I kept learning, experimenting, and refining my skills. Returning to the workforce as a Technical Support Engineer, I honed my real-time troubleshooting skills, developed strong customer empathy, and learned to translate complex technical challenges into clear, actionable solutions. Yet, my true aspiration remained in DevOps.</p>

            <p>Embracing the DevOps craft fully, I mastered CI/CD pipelines, Docker containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, Infrastructure-as-Code tools like Terraform and Ansible, cloud deployments on AWS, and monitoring solutions such as Prometheus and Grafana. I began designing automated, scalable environments that could be deployed and maintained with confidence. Integrating security at every stage, I practice DevSecOps principles — embedding security into the development lifecycle through continuous security testing, automated compliance checks, and proactive vulnerability management. My approach ensures systems are not only efficient and scalable but also resilient against evolving threats.</p>
            
            <p>Today, I leverage a unique blend of security expertise, network architecture, automation, and cloud engineering to build secure, scalable, and self-sustaining systems — systems designed to just work, with security as a fundamental pillar.</p>
